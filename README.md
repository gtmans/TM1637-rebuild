# TM1637-rebuild: rebuild of an TM1637 module using an 7segment display and a TM1637 dip10 chip

TM1637 modules with 4-digit 7-segment display are easy to use in any project but the real beaty is never revealed. Time to recreate a TM1637 module using a TM1637 dip10 chip and a 4-digit 7-segment common anode (CA) display. An ATTiny85 and an AM2122 temperature and humidity sensor turns it in a small weatherstation that alternately displays room temperature and humidity.
First I designed the layoutplan in Fritzing and built a working breadboard model. Then I used TinkerCad to arrange all the brass (0.8mm) wires neatly. Most difficult was the real creation with my solder iron. #funproject
